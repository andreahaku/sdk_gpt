# Electron

The MetaMask SDK for Electron should work exactly the same as for web apps if you are using it on the frontend and it should work exactly the same as nodeJS if you are using it on the backend, so please check:

- For frontend, [check the web apps section](metamask-sdk-react.html)
- For backend, [check the nodeJS section](metamask-sdk-nodejs.html)
