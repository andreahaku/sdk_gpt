# Language Model Document Retriever (MetaMask SDK Docs test)

This repository contains a Node.js application that uses OpenAI's GPT-4-based model to answer questions related to a set of documents. Specifically the MetaMask SDK documentation.

The application first processes the documents, creating a vector store for efficient retrieval, and then provides an interactive prompt for users to ask questions.

## Features

- Load and process documents from a specified directory.
- Split documents into chunks using Markdown text splitter.
- Create a vector store for efficient document retrieval.
- Use OpenAI's GPT-4-based model to answer questions.
- Provide an interactive prompt for users to ask questions.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v16.x.x or higher

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andreahaku/sdk_gpt.git
cd sdk_gpt
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a .env file in the project root directory and add your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Replace your_openai_api_key_here with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Usage

Add your documents (in Markdown format) to the sdk_docs directory.

### Run the application (test questions):

```
yarn start
```

### Run the application (interactive):

```
yarn start:interactive
```

An interactive prompt will appear, allowing you to ask questions related to the documents:

```
Enter your question or type 'exit' to quit:
```

Type your question and press Enter. The application will provide an answer based on the processed documents. To exit the interactive prompt, type `exit` and press Enter.

### Run as REST API server:

```
yarn start:server
```

The server will start and listen for incoming requests on port 3000 (or the port specified in the PORT environment variable).

To interact with the API, use any HTTP client, such as Postman, Insomnia, or a simple command-line tool like curl. You can also use a library like axios or fetch in JavaScript to make requests from another application.
The API has a single endpoint /ask that accepts POST requests containing a JSON payload with the question. Here's an example of how to send a request to the API using curl:

```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:3000/ask \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "question": "How can I install MetaMask SDK on iOS?"
  }'
```
